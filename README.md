# NBA-DBALL-Rating
A new way to see how an NBA player is affecting the game on the defensive side of the ball! 

# DBALL Rating is calculated by coverting the values of blocks, steals, rebounds, deflections, and Defensive Rating, and using those to get an accurate reflection on how a player is doing on defense.
